!  Purpose: This routine is called before the time loop starts and is  !
!           user-definable.  The user may insert code in this routine  !
!           or call appropriate user defined subroutines.  This        !
!           can be used for setting constants and checking errors in   !
!           data.  This routine is not called from an IJK loop, hence  !
!           all indices are undefined.                                 !
!                                                                      !
