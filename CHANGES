Changes from MFIX 2015-2 (Date: 10/27/2015) to MFIX 2016-1 (Date: 04/01/2016)


New features added:
-------------------

* DMP support for DEM thermochemistry - MFIX-DEM simulations with heat transfer
  and/or chemical reactions now support parallel execution. This allows for
  larger particle counts in reacting flow simulations with reduced time-to-
  solution for greater modeling capability of MFIX-DEM.

* DEM particle-wall heat transfer - MFIX-DEM particles may exchange heat with
  the domain boundaries via specified constant wall temperature boundary 
  conditions. The rotating drum with particle-wall heat transfer tutorial 
  illustrates this new feature (INSTERT LOCATION HERE)

Changes in existing features:
-----------------------------

* Greater UDF capabilities - Users may construct user-defined functions (UDFs)
  to specify source terms to the governing equations and many transport
  coefficients and field properties. This allows for faster model development
  by removing the need to modify master source routines. See usr_source.f and
  usr_prop.f routines and the UDF keyword section for more information.
